    1. Lowercase letters
    1. Uppercase letters
    1. Numbers
    1. Special characters
1. A user then chooses a password length
    1. The length can be between 8 to 128 characters
1. To generate the password with the desired length and criteria, click the 'Generate Password' button
    1. Note: If the criteria and/or length is not selected by the user, when the generate button is clicked, it will display error messaging depending on what the user has left blank
